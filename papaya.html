		         	<li>Papaya is the fruit of the Carica papaya plant. </li>
		         	<li> Papayas are shaped similar to pears and can be up to 20 inches (51 cm) long. </li>
		         	<li>The skin is green when unripe and orange when ripe, while the flesh is yellow, orange or red. The fruit also has many black seeds, which are edible but bitter.</li>
		         	<li>Papayas contain high levels of antioxidants vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin E.</li>
		         	<li>Diets high in antioxidants may reduce the risk of heart disease. </li>
		         	<li>The antioxidants prevent the oxidation of cholesterol.</li>
		         	<li> When cholesterol oxidizes, it's more likely to create blockages that lead to heart disease.</li>
		         	<li>Papaya is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when taken by mouth in large amounts or when applied to the skin as papaya latex.</li>
